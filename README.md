The dataset consists of 15 attributes and 9801 data. With this data we visualized different segments of illustrations like: Sales by Category, Sales by State, Sales by Segment, Sales Trend, Top 10 items, and Sales by Region. After making each of this analysis, I then created two dashboards covering all these segments analysis: Supermarket Analytics 1 & 2. 

The dataset consists of the following attributes: Order ID, Order Date, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, and Product ID.

The attached Pdf file has the visualizations that is done with tableau.
